# ModDNS: Universal Network Performance Optimizer

## üåê Overview

ModDNS is an advanced, cross-platform DNS configuration and network optimization utility designed to enhance your system's network performance, security, and reliability. This powerful tool automatically selects the fastest DNS servers, configures network parameters, and provides comprehensive network diagnostics across multiple Linux distributions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Arch Linux, Manjaro, and OpenSUSE
- **Intelligent DNS Selection**: Automatically identifies and configures the fastest DNS servers
- **Network Performance Optimization**: Applies advanced TCP/UDP and network core performance tweaks
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging with timestamped, categorized messages
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive checks and fallback mechanisms
- **Security-Focused**: Configures DNS with multiple redundant servers
- **Easy-to-Use**: Single command execution with minimal user intervention

## üöÄ Prerequisites

- Linux-based operating system
- Root/sudo privileges
- Internet connection

## üîç What ModDNS Does

1. **OS Detection**: Automatically identifies your Linux distribution
2. **Dependency Check**: Installs required network utilities
3. **DNS Performance Testing**: 
   - Pings multiple DNS providers
   - Selects the fastest, most responsive DNS server
4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Updates `/etc/resolv.conf`
   - Configures NetworkManager
   - Applies network performance optimizations
5. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Verifies DNS resolution for multiple domains
   - Logs all actions and potential issues

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- DNS servers are selected based on performance and reliability
- Configuration prevents potential DNS leaks
- Immutable resolv.conf prevents unauthorized modifications
- Detailed logging for auditing and troubleshooting

## üìã Logging

Detailed logs are maintained at `/var/log/dns_optimizer.log`, providing:
- Timestamp of actions
- Action types (INFO, WARN, ERROR, SUCCESS)
- Specific details about network configuration
